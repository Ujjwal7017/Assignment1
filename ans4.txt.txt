Steps that I followed to connect my github with my local repo are :

1) run the commond $ ssh-keygen in terminal
2) A folder will be generated named .ssh contains public and private ssh key.
3)Now open the settings in your github  and add new ssh public key.
4) Create a local repo and open it in terminal then run the following commonds :
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/Ujjwal7017/Assignment1.git
git push origin master

5) This will connect our local repo to github repo with content.
