// Architecture of NodeJS
It basically consists of three components ie;
1)Call Stack
2)NodeJS
3)Call back Queue

NodeJS Processing Model is based on the JavaScript Event loop based model along with the JavaScript callback
Mechanism.

NodeJS runs event-driven operations, where each task is triggered by the use of events which deploys a callback function. 
The NodeJs runtime is an asynchronous operation and doesn't block other tasks while enabling a smooth operation.
